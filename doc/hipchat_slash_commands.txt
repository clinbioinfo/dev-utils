Room actions

/join <room name> – Join an existing room.

/part– Leave the room you’re currently in.

/topic <msg> – Set the topic for the current room.



Setting your status

/available | /back | /here <msg> – Shortcut for setting your status to available (green dot). The <msg> part is optional.

/away <msg> – Set your status to away (yellow dot). In appearance, this is the same as going idle, except it doesn’t automatically return your status to ‘available’ when you come back.

/dnd – Set status to do not disturb (red dot).


Formatting

/code <msg> – Displays the message with code syntax highlighting (language is autodetected).

/quote <msg> – Displays the message formatted with a monospace font, regardless of length or number of newlines in the message.

/me | /em <msg> – The “emote” command. This will let you display a line of grey text with your name at the beginning, similar to the style room join and leave messages. For example, if I typed “/me is happy.” it would show “Jeff Park is happy.” in the chat.

/clear – Temporarily clear the chat history in the current room or 1-1 chat. (The history comes back when you reopen the room or chat.)
